# Healthcare Chatbot with IBM Watson Assistant and Python
I developed an advanced healthcare chatbot with IBM cloud services and Python to diagnose a disease with symptoms and show information about the disease. The project involved creating a python script that integrates with the Medic API to predict disease based on symptoms, year of birth and gender. Then built a chatbot on IBM Cloud using IBM Watson Assistant by defining entities, action and their respective responses. To enhance functionality, I implemented a node to call API and finally added integration with webchat and customised the chat UI for a user friendly experience.
